![Logo](./assets/icon.png)

## Overview 📋
🕵️‍♂️ Based on the work of [Willy-JL](https://github.com/Willy-JL), [Spooks4576](https://github.com/Spooks4576), and [ECTO-1A](https://github.com/ECTO-1A), this Android app extends the capabilities of the Flipper Zero BLE Spam tool, enabling protocol spoofing across a wide range of devices and operating systems. It currently supports Apple Continuity Protocol, Google Fast Pair Protocol, Samsung EasySetup Protocol, and Microsoft SwiftPair Protocol.

## Key Features 🔑
### Apple Continuity Protocol Spoofing 🍏
- Spoof Nearby Actions Modals and Proximity Pair Popup on iOS and iPadOS devices.
- Trigger system crashes on iOS 17 (iPhone 12 or newer), leading to a reboot.

### Google Fast Pair Protocol Spoofing 🤖
- Emulate Google Fast Pair Protocol, compatible with most modern Android phones.
- More than 195 different devices spoofed.

### Samsung EasySetup Protocol Spoofing 📲
- Mimic the Samsung EasySetup Protocol for Buds and Watch devices.
- The most effective way for Android, the target phone/tablet is literally unusable while activated.

### Microsoft SwiftPair Protocol Spoofing 💻
- Spoof Microsoft's SwiftPair Protocol, simplifying device pairing on Windows.
- Spoof devices with the name of your choice.

## Requirements 📦
- Android 8.0 (API level 26) or later

## Installation 🚀
Get started with the BLE Spammer App through two simple methods:

### Prebuilt APK (Recommended) 📦
- Download the prebuilt and signed APK from the [Release section](#).

### Building from Source 🛠️
- Clone this repository and open it in Android Studio.
- Compile the app to create a customized APK.

## Usage 🚀
Experiment with BLE protocol spoofing like a pro:

1. Launch the app.
2. Configure the delay between each packet (recommended: 500ms or 1000ms).
3. Select the protocol you want to spoof from the available options.

**Note**: Combine multiple protocols for ultimate flexibility (performance may be affected).

## Customization 🛠️
While the current version offers packet delay customization, future updates promise even more fine-tuned options. 🚀 Developers and contributors are invited to expand the realm of BLE protocol spoofing and uncover its hidden intricacies.

## Known Limitations ⚠️
Here's what you should know:

- Restricted to the device's internal Bluetooth antenna, leading to a limited operational range.
- Hardware limitations might affect range, speed, and effectiveness.
